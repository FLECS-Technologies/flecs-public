mosquitto \- an MQTT broker

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmosquitto\fR
is a broker for the MQTT protocol version 5\&.0/3\&.1\&.1/3\&.1\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\-file\fR
.RS 4
Load configuration from a file\&. If not given, then the broker will listen on port 1883 bound to the loopback interface, and the default values as described in
\fBmosquitto.conf\fR(5)
are used\&.

See the

option for a description of changes in behaviour from 1\&.6\&.x to 2\&.0\&.

.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-daemon\fR
.RS 4
Run
\fBmosquitto\fR
in the background as a daemon\&. All other behaviour remains the same\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR
.RS 4
Listen on the port specified\&. May be specified up to 10 times to open multiple sockets listening on different ports\&.

\fBImportant\fR
.ps -1
.br
In version 1\&.6\&.x and earlier, the listener defined by
\fB\-p\fR
(or the default port of 1883) would be bound to all interfaces and so be accessible from any network\&. It could also be used in combination with
\fB\-c\fR\&.
.sp
From version 2\&.0 onwards, the listeners defined with
\fB\-p\fR
are bound to the loopback interface only, and so can only be connected to from the local machine\&. If both
\fB\-p\fR
is used and a listener is defined in a configuration file, then the
\fB\-p\fR
options are IGNORED\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Use verbose logging\&. This is equivalent to setting
\fBlog_type\fR
to
\fBall\fR
in the configuration file\&. This overrides and logging options given in the configuration file\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The broker can be configured using a configuration file as described in
\fBmosquitto.conf\fR(5)
and this is the main point of information for mosquitto\&. The files required for SSL/TLS support are described in
\fBmosquitto-tls\fR(7)\&.
.SH "PLATFORM LIMITATIONS"
.PP
Some versions of Windows have limitations on the number of concurrent connections due to the Windows API being used\&. In modern versions of Windows, e\&.g\&. Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019, this is approximately 8192 connections\&. In earlier versions of Windows, this limit is 2048 connections\&.
.SH "MQTT SUPPORT"
.PP
Mosquitto supports MQTT v5\&.0, v3\&.1\&.1, and v3\&.1\&.
.SS "MQTT v5\&.0"
.PP
Mosquitto provides full MQTT v5\&.0 support, but some features are not used directly\&. The following sections describe the new features and explain where Mosquitto does not make use of a feature\&.

\fBFeatures\fR
.RS 4
.PP
\fBEnhanced authentication\fR
.RS 4
Basic MQTT authentication uses username/password checks\&. Enhanced authentication allows different authentication schemes to be integrated into MQTT, and even those schemes with multiple step processes\&. Clients request a particular type of authentication and if the broker is configured for that scheme the authentication continues\&. Mosquitto supports enhanced authentication through plugins\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBError handling\fR
.RS 4
Most MQTT packets now have the concept of a
\fBreason code\fR
which indicates success or failure, and what the failure was\&. Mosquitto provides full support for reason codes, but does not make use of the
\fBreason string\fR
feature which can be used to provide a human readable error string to explain the reason code\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBFlow control\fR
.RS 4
The number of "in flight" messages for QoS 1 and QoS 2 can be controlled by both the client and the broker\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBRequest / response\fR
.RS 4
MQTT v5\&.0 adds a request/response pattern that allows a client to publish a message and instruct the subscribers of that message where to publish a response\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBServer redirection\fR
.RS 4
Server redirection is the concept of telling a client to connect to a different MQTT broker, either on CONNECT or with a broker initiated DISCONNECT\&. Mosquitto does not currently make use of this feature\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBShared subscriptions\fR
.RS 4
When multiple clients subscribe to the same shared subscription, only one client out of the group will receive each message which allows for distributing work loads\&.

.PP
Mosquitto provides full MQTT v3\&.1 support\&.
.SS "MQTT v3"
.PP
MQTT v3 is an obsolete version of the protocol that does not support username/password authentication and used the

Clients can find information about the broker by subscribing to topics in the $SYS hierarchy as follows\&. Topics marked as static are only sent once per client on subscription\&. All other topics are updated every

seconds\&. If
\fBsys_interval\fR
is 0, then updates are not sent\&.
.PP
Note that if you are using a command line client to interact with the $SYS topics and your shell interprets $ as an environment variable, you need to place the topic in single quotes \*(Aq$SYS/\&.\&.\&.\*(Aq or to escape the dollar symbol: \e$SYS/\&.\&.\&. otherwise the $SYS will be treated as an environment variable\&.

.SH "WILDCARD TOPIC SUBSCRIPTIONS"
.PP
In addition to allowing clients to subscribe to specific topics, mosquitto also allows the use of two wildcards in subscriptions\&.
\fB+\fR
is the wildcard used to match a single level of hierarchy\&. For example, for a topic of "a/b/c/d", the following example subscriptions will match:
.sp

The $SYS hierarchy does not match a subscription of "#"\&. If you want to observe the entire $SYS hierarchy, subscribe to $SYS/#\&.
.PP
Note that the wildcards must be only ever used on their own, so a subscription of "a/b+/c" is not valid use of a wildcard\&. The
\fB#\fR
wildcard must only ever be used as the final character of a subscription\&.
.SH "BRIDGES"
.PP
Multiple brokers can be connected together with the bridging functionality\&. This is useful where it is desirable to share information between locations, but where not all of the information needs to be shared\&. An example could be where a number of users are running a broker to help record power usage and for a number of other reasons\&. The power usage could be shared through bridging all of the user brokers to a common broker, allowing the power usage of all users to be collected and compared\&. The other information would remain local to each broker\&.
.PP
For information on configuring bridges, see
\fBmosquitto.conf\fR(5)\&.
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
On POSIX systems Mosquitto can receive signals and act on them as described below\&. To send signals, use e\&.g\&.
\fBkill \-HUP <process id of mosquitto>\fR
.PP
SIGHUP
.RS 4
Upon receiving the SIGHUP signal, mosquitto will attempt to reload configuration file data, assuming that the
\fB\-c\fR
argument was provided when mosquitto was started\&. Not all configuration parameters can be reloaded without restarting\&. See
\fBmosquitto.conf\fR(5)
for details\&.
.sp
If TLS certificates are in use, then mosquitto will also reload certificate on receiving a SIGHUP\&.
.RE
.PP
SIGUSR1
.RS 4
Upon receiving the SIGUSR1 signal, mosquitto will write the persistence database to disk\&. This signal is only acted upon if persistence is enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
SIGUSR2
.RS 4
The SIGUSR2 signal causes mosquitto to print out the current subscription tree, along with information about where retained messages exist\&. This is intended as a testing feature only and may be removed at any time\&.
