## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a permanent process. We go through this process every day in order to be able to provide our users with a product that is secure according to the state of the art.
If you discover a security vulnerability through use or code review, please report it to security@flecs.tech. If you want to remain anonymous, that's fine with us, as well as if you want to be explicitly named as the finder of the vulnerability. Just mention this in your email.
Also, please always name the component and its version in which you discovered the vulnerability. If you can, then describe how you discovered the vulnerability and how you reproduce it. We also appreciate your suggestions on how to fix the vulnerability.
We will keep you up to date and will publish an advisory here on Github after our first assessment. You are also welcome to come to our Slack workspace and contact us directly.
